Candidate Search 

#Description
The Candidate Search Application is a web-based tool that allows users to review potential candidates and save or reject them. It displays relevant details about each candidate, provides navigation through available candidates, and maintains a list of saved candidates even after page reloads.

#Features
âœ… Candidate Display:
Shows a single candidate at a time, displaying their name, location, avatar, email, GitHub profile URL, and company.

âœ… Candidate Selection:
"+" Button: Saves the current candidate to the list of potential candidates and moves to the next.
"-" Button: Skips the current candidate without saving and moves to the next.

âœ… End of Candidates Notification:
Displays a message when there are no more candidates available to review.

âœ… Saved Candidates Page:
Shows a list of previously saved candidates with their name, location, avatar, email, GitHub profile URL, and company.

âœ… Persistent Data:
The list of saved candidates remains available even after page reloads.

âœ… No Saved Candidates Notification:
If no candidates have been saved, an appropriate message is displayed.

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

* [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md), which uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
* [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc), which uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you're developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

* Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property as follows:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

* Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` with `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`.
* Optionally, add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`.
* Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` and `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list.
